A complete repository of Reinforcement Learning algorithms ranging from fundamental to advanced techniques with modular implementations, benchmarks, and real-world applications.

An ever-growing collection of RL algorithms sourced from various texts-scripts, books, and courses posted in this repository. The repo is intended to be, through some elementary modules and detailed documentation, a platform from which RL learning and applying can be expanded.

What This Repo Contains:

✔️ Comprehensive RL Work-From Bandit Problems, Better Known as Dynamic Programming to Deep RL (DQN, PPO, SAC), and Beyond

✔️ Mathematical Insights-One clear derivation and lucid explanation for every algorithm

✔️ Scalability & Reusability-Easily modified and integrated with larger machine learning projects.

✔️ Performance Benchmarks-Visual comparisons of different strategies (simulations, real-world applications)

Why Repo? This is not merely another repository of RL scripts; this is a structured and continuously growing repository that aims to serve well for both research and real-world robotics applications. If you are learning RL or building RL-driven robots, this is the repository for you.
